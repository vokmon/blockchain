Run Truffle
..\node_modules\.bin\truffle init  version

Note: needs to run in an empty folder
..\node_modules\.bin\truffle init

Compile
..\node_modules\.bin\truffle compile

contracts directory: this is where all smart contacts live. 
We already have a Migration contract that handles our migrations to the blockchain.

migrations directory: this is where all of the migration files live. 
These migrations are similar to other web development frameworks that require migrations 
to change the state of a database. Whenever we deploy smart contracts to the blockchain, 
we are updating the blockchain's state, and therefore need a migration.

node_modules directory: this is the home of all of our Node dependencies we just installed.

test directory: this is where we'll write our tests for our smart contract.

truffle-config.js file: this is the main configuration file for our Truffle project, 
where we'll handle things like network configuration.

After running ..\node_modules\.bin\truffle compile
there will be ./build/contracts/TodoList.json
smart contract ABI file, which stands for "Abstract Binary Interface"

It contains the compiled bytecode version of the Solidity smart 
contract code that can be run on a the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), i.e., an Ethereum Node.

It contains a JSON representation of the smart contract functions that can be
 exposed to external clients, like client-side JavaScript applications.


Update config file in
 config truffle-config.js

create a migration script inside the migrations directory to deploy the smart contract to the personal blockchain network.
whenever we permanently change it, we must migrate it from one state to another. This is very similar to a database migration
Notice that we number all of our files inside the migrations directory with numbers so that Truffle knows which order to execute them in. 
  create 2_deploy_contracts.js --> update it
  ..\node_modules\.bin\truffle migrate


To deploy
..\node_modules\.bin\truffle console
inside the console
todoList = await TodoList.deployed()
todoList.address
taskCount = await todoList.taskCount() --> result is <BN: 0> (big number 0)


..\node_modules\.bin\truffle compile
..\node_modules\.bin\truffle migrate


smart contract code is immutable! It cannot change. 
Therefore, we must create a new smart contract any time we make code changes.
Truffle provides a shortcut to assist with this.

..\node_modules\.bin\truffle migrate --reset
todoList = await TodoList.deployed()
task = await todoList.tasks(1)


Of the front end
use "lite-server" to serve all of the project files for the client side.
1. expose all the files in the src and build/contracts directories to the root of our web server
2. adds an alias for any files in the node_modules directory to appear in the vendor

Test
..\node_modules\.bin\truffle test
then deploy
..\node_modules\.bin\truffle migrate --reset
