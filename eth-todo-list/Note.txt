Run Truffle
..\node_modules\.bin\truffle init  version

Note: needs to run in an empty folder
..\node_modules\.bin\truffle init

contracts directory: this is where all smart contacts live. 
We already have a Migration contract that handles our migrations to the blockchain.

migrations directory: this is where all of the migration files live. 
These migrations are similar to other web development frameworks that require migrations 
to change the state of a database. Whenever we deploy smart contracts to the blockchain, 
we are updating the blockchain's state, and therefore need a migration.

node_modules directory: this is the home of all of our Node dependencies we just installed.

test directory: this is where we'll write our tests for our smart contract.

truffle-config.js file: this is the main configuration file for our Truffle project, 
where we'll handle things like network configuration.
